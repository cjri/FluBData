This repository contains processed data describing within-host infection with influenza B.  Data are associated with the paper by Lumby et al., published in Clinical Infectious Diseases (currently in press as of 26th Feb 2020).

The file Times.in records the days on which samples were collected.  The format for the Variants file is:

Locus  #A nucleotides  #C nucleotides  #G nucleotides  #T nucleotides  #Reads at locus


The HCV01 directory constains processed data describing the repeated sequencing of HCV viral samples; the original samples are described in the paper by Illingworth et al., Virus Evolution, 2017.  These samples were used to assess the performance of our sequencing pipeline.
