This code conducts Wright-Fisher simulations on influenza-like populations.  It requires input data giving allele frequencies for each segment of a virus.  According to the default options, these data are in sequentially-named directories Seg1, Seg2, Seg3, etc. in the Data directory.

Given a population size, the code initiates a population, then simulates one generation of the evolution of that population under genetic drift.  It then reports the distance between the two populations, measured as a generalised Hamming distance between the before and after samples.

The code can be compiled using the command:

make eff

and is then run as

./comp_sim_eff <seed> <options>

Options can be specified as follows:

--bottle : Specifies the population size.

--rstart : If set to 1, initates the population using random frequency information for each segment.  Otherwise the first samples is used to initiate the population each time.

--multi : If set to 1, repeats the Wright-Fisher step multiple times, each time beginning from the same initial population.  Rather than a distance, this flag causes the output of files containing the initial allele frequencies, and the allele frequencies of each final population.

--reps : Sets the number of repeats of the Wright-Fisher step.  If multi is not set to 1, this is overridden, defaulting to a single repeat.

--process : If set to 1, reads in frequencies output by the multi option, calculating distances from these frequencies.  No simulation is conducted with this option.

--cut_variants : Set by default to 1.  If set to 1, removes a random proportion of the variation in the initial set of allele frequencies, equivalent to the calculated rate of false positive variant calling described in the article which this code accompanies.

--min_q : Set by default to 0.001.  In the calculation of a distance between simulated samples, all variants lower than this threshold are increased to this threshold; in effect frequency changes below this value are ignored in the calculation of the total distance.

--add_ld : If set to 1, assigns frequencies to genomes in the generation of the initial population in such a way as to induce linkage disequilibrium.  In effect, the sequences are ordered, with variants assigned to sequences beginning with a random sequence k, and proceeding through the sequences k+1, k+2, etc, cycling back to 0 if the end of the list is reached.
